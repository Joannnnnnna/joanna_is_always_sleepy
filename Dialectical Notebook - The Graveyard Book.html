<h2>The first voice:</h2>
<p>The sky was filled with stars.
“They’re beautiful,” said Bod.
“When we get you home,” said Miss Lupescu, “I teach you the names of stars and their constellations.”
(The Graveyard Book p.95)

<h2>The second voice:</h2>
<p>In my opinion, Ms. Lupescu portrayed an imaginative and realistic future to Bod. This method is useful to comfort a little boy who was been saved by her. Also, the sky is meaningful to Bod, too. He was rescued by Night-Gaunt from sky twice. The way that Bod called them was also taught by Miss Lupescu. So it is a contrast from beginning to the end of the chapter.

<h2>The third voice:</h2>
<p>When I was little, the most expected thing for me is that my mother would bring me back to home. I always share everything happened on that day to her, and she would response . Or I would ask her some questions, and she always answered me patiently. Sometimes my mom took me the park and taught me the name of stars, and how to recognize them in the vast universe. Because She grew up in the countryside. At that time, electricity was not common, so they can saw the stars easily. My grandpa taught them how to recognize the stars, too. So, my mom wanted to teach me as well. That is heartwarming in my childhood.
